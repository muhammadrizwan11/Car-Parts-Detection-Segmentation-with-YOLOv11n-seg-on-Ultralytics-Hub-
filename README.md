# Car Parts Detection & Segmentation using YOLOv11n-seg (Ultralytics Hub)

This project demonstrates how to use **YOLOv11n-seg** on the **Car Parts** dataset using the **Ultralytics Hub** for training and segmentation.

The model is trained using the Ultralytics Hub, which provides a simple interface to:
- Select datasets and models
- Train on free Google Cloud infrastructure
- Monitor training results via dashboard
- Test and export models in different formats

## 🚗 Project Overview

- **Model**: YOLOv11n-seg (lightweight and efficient segmentation model)
- **Dataset**: Car Parts (from Ultralytics Hub public datasets)
- **Platform**: [Ultralytics Hub](https://hub.ultralytics.com)
- **Task**: Object detection and segmentation of car parts
- **Training**: Cloud-based (no local GPU needed)
- **Results**: Accessible and visualized via Hub Dashboard
